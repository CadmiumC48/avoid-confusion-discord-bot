# Contributing to AvoidConfusion

AvoidConfusion is open source so you can contribute to it easily. However, we have some spesifications on how to contribute this repository.

1. **Use C\# only.** The bot is written in DSharpPlus, which is a Discord API wrapper for .NET.
2. **Explain your problem as clearly as possible while creating an issue.**
3. **Try not uploading assemblies while commiting to this repository.** Even I upload assemblies sometimes, but the _.gitignore_ file doesn't do anything and let the assemblies be committed.
